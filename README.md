# APRP
* James Condo, 2025
* This is a GitHub repository which includes the code used for the Applied Planning Research Paper, Presented in Partial Fulfillment of the Requirements for the Degree Master of City and Regional Planning in the Graduate School of The Ohio State University
* APRP Committee Includes: Dr. Mattijs van Maasakkers, Advisor; Dr. Bernadette Hanlon, Secondary Advisor; and Dr. Harley Etienne, Committee Member 
* Data obtained from the US Census Bureau for the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) (US Census Bureau, 2023) and from the `tidycensus` package for American Community Survey data (Walker & Herman, 2025). 
* The main code documents are the main R file, and the Python conversion script for large pipe-delimited `.csv` files.
* The fully converted SIPP database is also available. Depending on your computing resources, R may have difficulty reading the CSV. Save an image of the unmodified data frame to shorten load times if you need to restart.
* For more information on `dplyr` and other packages in the `tidyverse`, see https://www.tidyverse.org/
